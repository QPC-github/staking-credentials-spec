# Staking Credentials - Specification

The core of Staking Credentials is a cryptographic protocol that allows users to receive an amount
of anonymous credentials in exchange of paying an on-chain or off-chain Bitcoin payment. The credentials
can be used to cover a Bitcoin financial contract counterparty risk (e.g a Lightning jamming) or
redeem a service from a CivKit functionary node.

The Staking Credentials protocol is building from IETF's [Privacy Pass](https://www.petsymposium.org/2018/files/papers/issue3/popets-2018-0026.pdf) with changes suiting decentralized financial networks and peer-to-peer
architecture.

Project status is in very early stage with an upcoming Rust implementation.

Descritpion of Staking Credentials in a CivKit flow can be found in section 8 of the paper.
